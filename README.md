# Eat-Da-Burger!
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

# Node Express Handlebars

I have built an application meant to log your burgers with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The app design pattern follows a MVC structure; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

The app is deployed on Heroku so whoever may want to fill it out can do as well.

# Instructions
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
